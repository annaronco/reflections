What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The repository is needed to keep and track the files hostory, as opposed
to a normal directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's an intermediate stage for the working directory and repository,
where I can store my changes,review and modify them before commiting
them to the repository - allows me to save a logical piece of work.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

I can choose and add to the staging area only the files that are
relevant to my logical commit.
