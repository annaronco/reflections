What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The repository is needed to keep and track the files hostory, as opposed
to a normal directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's an intermediate stage for the working directory and repository,
where I can store my changes,review and modify them before commiting
them to the repository - allows me to save a logical piece of work.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

I can choose and add to the staging area only the files that are
relevant to my logical commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

Branches can be used for different purposes, e.g. developing a new feature
or experimenting and then deleted or merged with the master branch. In the
meantime there can be work going on on other branches separately.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagram shows the non-linear character of git and helps understanding that
commits have parent and can be tracked back to the initial commit of
a branch and that some commits (like detached head) can be not accessible.
