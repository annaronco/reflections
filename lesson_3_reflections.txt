When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote to collaborate with other people, be able to push my changes so
they can see it and add to it and to pull their changes to my local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I want to pull the changes in a sensible time to check the changes that
have been done to origin by others.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

fork: a copy of a github repo on github - if I want to develop something new
out of someone else's repo and not influence his code.
clone: a clone of git repo on my computer or a copy of a local repo - if I
want to work locally on something and then push changes to github e.g.
when I colaborate with others.
branch: to be able to develop separately from the master branch and keep
the code on master working.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

The more often I sync the origin with my local master, the less merge
conflicts I will get. I will be working on the most recent version.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

It would be easier to just work on my local version and do not care about remotes.
Sharing and merging my work with other ppl's work would be a nightmare.
