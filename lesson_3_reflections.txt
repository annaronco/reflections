When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote to collaborate with other people, be able to push my changes so
they can see it and add to it and to pull their changes to my local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I want to pull the changes in a sensible time to check the changes that
have been done to origin by others.
